## User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project 1 -- Long Hill

Long Hill is my favorite place near my home. It's a beautiful estate managed by the Trustees of Reservations. I hope this website will let users discover this hidden gem in North Shore and come visit, enjoy the beauty and become a member to support the Trustees.

## UX
### As a user 
* I can read about the history of this property.
* I can see the photos in different seasons.
* I can find directions to the estate.
* I can sign up to be a member.

### As a website owner
* I want people to know and visit this beautiful place.
* I want to share the photos I took over the years.
* I want to people to become a member to support the trustees.

## Features
* Navbar – On each page there is a Navbar on the top which allow the user to navigate between different pages.
* Footer – There is a Footer area on each page with few social media icon links. Unfortunately there are no social media site for Long Hill at this point. All icon link to the Trustees website. I put them there just to show my understanding of the subject.
* Home page – is the landing page with a picture of Long Hill and three buttons that will take the user to Discover page, location map and signup page.
* Discover page – has a little history of the estate and photos with text wrap around images. Original design was to have a paragraph of the history and four photo links for the four seasons. Since I do not have the knowledge to handle large amount of photos using database I put a photo slides at the bottom of the page.
* Join us page – is the place to signup to become a member. Each field required to fill up before submission.

## Technologies Used
* HTML5
* CSS3
* GidPod for code editing
* Bootstrap 4
* Google Chrome Dev Tools
* Figma for creating project wireframes
