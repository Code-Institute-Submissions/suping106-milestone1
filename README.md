## User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project 1 -- Long Hill

Long Hill is my favorite place at North Shore. It's a beautiful estate managed by the Trustees of Reservations. I hope this website will let users discover this hidden gem in North Shore and come visit, enjoy the beauty, become a member and support the Trustees.

My Long Hill website can be accessed [here](https://suping106.github.io/milestone1/)

## Wireframes

I used Figma to creat the wireframes for the original design of the project. During the development phase some modifications and improvements were made to the project when I moved along.

## Features

### Existing Features

- Navbar – On each page there is a Navbar on the top which allow the user to navigate between different pages.
- Footer – There is a Footer area on each page with few social media icon links. Unfortunately there are no social media site for Long Hill at this point. All icon link to the Trustees website. I put them there just to show my understanding of the subject.
- Home page – is the landing page with a picture of Long Hill and three buttons that will take the user to Discover page, location map and signup page.
- Discover page – has a little history of the estate and photos with text wrap around images. Original design was to have a paragraph of the history and four photo links for the four seasons. Since I do not have the knowledge to handle large amount of photos using database I put a photo slides at the bottom of the page.
- Join us page – is the place to signup to become a member. Each field required to fill up before submission.
- Responsive design

### Future Features

- Photo gallery
